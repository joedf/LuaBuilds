This is a self-running Lua interpreter.  It is meant to be combined with
a Lua program  into a single, stand-alone program that  will execute the
given Lua program when it is run.

The command-line  arguments will be  available to  the Lua program  in a
table called "arg" and also as '...'. All standard Lua libraries will be
available too.  If you want  to use a  different set of  libraries, just
copy linit.c from the Lua source, add it to srlua.c, and edit loadedlibs
and preloadedlibs to suit your needs (lualibs in Lua 5.1).

For each Lua program that you want to turn into a stand-alone program, do
	srglue srlua prog.lua a.out ; chmod +x a.out
Of course, you can use any name instead of a.out.

For Windows, you need to create srlua.exe and srglue.exe first. Then,
for each Lua program that you want to turn into a stand-alone program, do
	srglue srlua.exe prog.lua prog.exe
Of course, you can use any name instead of prog.exe.

To build srlua and srglue and run a simple test, just do make.
If Lua is not installed in /usr/local, tell make:
	make LUA_TOPDIR=/var/tmp/lhf/lua-5.3.5/install

To install srlua and srglue where you can find it, use a variant of these:
	make install
	sudo make install
	sudo make install INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin
